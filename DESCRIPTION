Description: Packages with C, C++, or Fortran code require a properly configured 
    toolchain and sometimes external system dependencies to build. Because these
    things vary a lot by platform, getting this all to work can be challenging. 
    The 'maketools' package contains a collection of helper functions that interface
    with the appropriate system utilities to learn about the build environment. 
    It lets you explore 'make' rules to test the local configuration, or query 
    'pkg-config' to find the cflags and libs needed for building packages with 
    external dependencies. It also contains tools to analyze which libraries
    that a installed R package is linked to, by inspecting output from 'ldd' in 
    combination with information from the distribution package manager, e.g. 
    'rpm' or 'dpkg'. For Windows there are special utilities to automatically
    find or install the suitable version of the Rtools build environment, and 
    diagnose some common problems.
