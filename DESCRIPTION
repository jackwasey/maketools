Description: The 'Makeconf' file is used by R to store system specific
    compilers, flags, and settings to build packages with C, C++, or Fortran
    code. This package allows you explore 'make' rules on your system and test
    the local configuration. It is particularly helpful on Windows and MacOS
    where compilers have to be installed manually via Rtools or Xcode.
