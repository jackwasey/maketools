Tools to test if a suitable version of Rtools is available, or help
the user to set this up.

\details{
Unlike most operating systems, Windows does not include a native compiler.
Hence in order to build R packages with compiled C/C++/Fortran code on
Windows, you need to install our custom toolchain bundle called Rtools.

There are currently 2 versions of Rtools available:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{rtools40}: required
for compiling packages on R-4.0 and newer
\item \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html}{rtools35}:
required for compiling packages on R-3.6 and older
}

The function \link{rtools_info} lists the Rtools versions that are installed
on your system (without touching any configurations).

The \link{rtools_setup} function interactively guides the user through setting
up and/or configuring Rtools. If rtools is not already installed, it will
prompt the user to do so. If needed, it sets the PATH and other variables
to the correct values. After running \code{rtools_setup()} everything is set
to install packages from source using \link{install.packages} and others.
